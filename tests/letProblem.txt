g _a _b = f _a _b

f _a _a = same
f _a _b = different

this works now that g is defined before f


the problem is that f is actually passed the Unknowns _a and _b instead of the things that get substituted for them.

intended reduction sequence:
g t y (_a is t and _b is y in definition of g _a _b)
f t y (_a is t and _b is y in second definition of f)
different
